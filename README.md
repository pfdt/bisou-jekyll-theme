# bisou - a cocktail recipes jekyll theme

I've made this theme to quickly browse and share to my friends all my best cocktail recipes.
This theme is compatible with jekyll-remote-theme and my personal website is live on : https://boozybisou.com.


## what can you do ?

- Browse recipes by categories (taste),
- Search recipes by name, categories, ingredients and more,
- View single pages for each recipe, including ingredients, instructions, image and source url,
- Login using Google sign-in to rate your favorite recipes or just create your "tonight menu",
- Use it on your mobile to assist you behind the bar.


## how it was made ?

I'm not a developer and this is my first time using jekyll and more broadly github, I hope it is not too dirty. :)
